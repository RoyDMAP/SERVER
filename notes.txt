the instruction to get access to python
in youre running a mac it is python3
else the instruction could be py, py3 or phython

this is the way we interact with the PIP 
-m      -from the modules
pip     -name of the module that i want to use
install -what i want to do
nameOfTheLibrary

to create a virtual environment, i need to install the virtualenv
   py -m pip install virtualenv

then we use the library to create virtual environments:
python3 -m venv venv               nameOfTheFolder

now we need to activate our virtual environment 

mac:

source venv/bin/activate 

win:

venv\Scripts\activate
